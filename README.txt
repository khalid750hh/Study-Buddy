Recombee: We are using the Recombee API and database to store users' majors, class standings, colleges, and courses and to make partner recommendations to these users. We 
		make calls to Recombee in our account creation process, editing profile process, and recommendation making process. If you are wondering about the database, 
		please contact me at richchen@bu.edu. If you create a Recombee account on https://www.recombee.com/, I can then add invite your account to view/edit our 
		Recombee project. Note: our free recombee trial ends around December 26. Please also contact richchen@bu.edu if you have any questions you want to ask about 
		our use of Recombee.
Stripe: Make sure to run the NodeJS server that can be found in the /Server subdirectory of this zip file. Once that is running, Stripe payments will work, but only on the 
	Android emulator. This is because the server is only hosted locally. You must be on that computer on an Android Virtual Device in order to make the payments in this
	app.
